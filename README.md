One simple example to learn about ROS1


#### System requirement
- Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS Noetic
  - Option I: [Using a VM on Windows](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/virtualbox-ubuntu-ros)
  - Option II: [Using Docker](https://varhowto.com/install-ros-noetic-docker/)    
  - Option III: Dual Boot! (There are lots of resources out there, and this is the most difficult option among the three. Choose with caution)
